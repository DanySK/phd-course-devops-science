### aka replicability crisis or reproducibility crisis

* ongoing *methodological crisis*
* the results of many scientific studies are hard or impossible to *reproduce*.

* empirical reproductions are essential for the the scientific method

#### no reproducibility $\Rightarrow$ scientific credibility is undermined

## Countermeasures

### Specifically for data science and computer science

* Make your artifacts *available*
  * Share code as open source (**licensing**)
  * Share code and data where people will find it (**GitHub**)
  * Share code and data where it will be archived for the forseeable future (**Zenodo**)
* Make your artifacts *reproducible*
  * It works on your PC? Ship your PC! (**containerization**)
* Make your artifacts *maintainable*
  * Be ready to accept contributions and work in team (**version control**)
  * Always check that the software is working (**continuous integration**)
* Make your artifacts *reusable*
  * document them appropriately (**GitHub Pages**)

Most techniques come from the DevOps world!
